### Usage
**Taco Dressings** plug-in only works with `.java` files. Also, the file must contain a method that begins with `public void test_` to function.

In order to use the plug-in, **right-click** on a `.java` file, and select the **Taco Dressings** option. A window will be displayed, with the test configurations of the method. The ones that are not included in the method, will be filled with the default value.

Once you finished configuring all the methods, click on the **Save** button in the upper-right corner of the window. This will immediately override the current `.java` file with all the new configurations.
